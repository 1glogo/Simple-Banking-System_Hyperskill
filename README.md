# Simple-Banking-System_Hyperskill

## Descritpion

This is an terminal based programme using an SQLite database along with JDBC simulating a simple banking system.

Program includes a random card number generator along with a Luhn number calculator for the card numbers provided.

The program can be run from the main file (./Simple Banking System/task/src/banking/Main.java).
The Filename should be passed to the program using 
-fileName argument when running the file, for example, -fileName fileName.db

For access (if not possible from the IDE) to the SQLite database we propose the use of DB Browser for SQLite (http://sqlitebrowser.org) or similar.

No testing file is provided as all testing was part of Jetbrains Hyperskill course.
